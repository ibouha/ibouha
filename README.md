## Hi there 👋, my name is Mohamed Amine IBOUHA

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from Morocco 🇲🇦, I'm passionate about web development and  I'm a huge fan of Next.js,Node.js, TypeScript, open-source💻. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. When I'm not coding or crushing bugs , you can find me playing football ⚽, listening to Pink Floyd 🎸, or watching  movies and series 🎬.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [Talib] (talib-neon.vercel.app), a platform designed to help students studying away from home. It simplifies housing searches, roommate matching, and item exchanges to make student life easier and more connected.
